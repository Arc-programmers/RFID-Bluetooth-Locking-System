# RFID-Bluetooth-Locking-System
This project implements an RFID access control system with Bluetooth integration using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system reads RFID cards and checks them against a list of allowed cards. If the card is allowed, it triggers a relay and provides visual and auditory feedback. Additionally, access can be granted via a Bluetooth command.
